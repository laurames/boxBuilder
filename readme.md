# BOX BUILDER - 3D box building with three.js

## Run
just oppen index.html and play around

## How to use
arrow keys are used for x and y coordinate movement of created boxes.
< = left (x)
> = right (x)
^ = up (y)
v = down (y)
z = inside (-z)
x = out (+z)

## Code
Main code is in js/main.js and the comments should explain what is happening

## Notes
There might still be small bugs with raycaster in the 3D space but iâ€™ve attached everything as .zip and also a small video to quickly show how it works.

Use Brackets inbuilt "Live Preview" to view the project if you don't want to 1.Setup a local server 2.Place Chrome security extensions or something else to overcome the error "Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https."

## Demo
Can be found on vimeo: https://vimeo.com/241652027

## Improvements
It would be great to manipulate all the individual auto generated boxes with changing their color etc. Also changing the dimensions of the individual boxes. Having the raycaster behave expectedly. Maybe add own music. Save the file to share with others... So many ideas so little time :)
